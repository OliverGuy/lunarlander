These programs rely mainly on `pytorch`, `gym` and `optuna`.

They can be ran in two ways:

1. `python main.py` will train a simple convolutional DDQN model (see `DQN.py`).

2. The `experiments.ipynb` notebook will let you run hyper-parameter tuning experiments on our full model (see `DQN_parametrized.py`).
